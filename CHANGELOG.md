# Changelog

**[1.3.0] and earlier moved to `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`** in the 2026-08-31 documentation pass -- this file had grown to 2,146 lines covering every version since `[0.1.2]`, most of it from the very early, rapid `[1.2.x]` patch cycle. The split point is `[1.4.0]`, this project's own documented milestone (the dual-tree-to-single-tree consolidation --
see the `[1.4.0]` entry below and `CONTRIBUTING.md`). Entries were relocated verbatim, not rewritten, per this project's convention that past changelog entries are a historical record (`CONTRIBUTING.md` §2) -- only the file they live in changed.


## [1.6.0] — QA-gate infrastructure, GDPR remediation, live-verified QGIS 4.2 fixes

- **Repo reconciliation.** This checkout and `cartogen-ai-community` had diverged as two
  private clones of the same remote with mutually unpushed commits since a shared ancestor.
  Reconciled: fast-forward pulled the already-merged `origin/main`, resolved the remaining
  local working-tree conflicts (a duplicate `clear_global_notes()`, a duplicate `class
  ConnectionType` stub, two silently-shadowed duplicate test methods — all found and fixed,
  not just merged over), and reapplied the held "hosted account" feature's Qt6 enum fix
  through the project's canonical `qgis_compat.enum_member()` helper.
- **QA-gate / dataset-status infrastructure**, built from a 27-point QGIS-first production
  standard review (`docs/QGIS_PRODUCTION_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_2026-09-04.md`): a real
  `INGESTED → STAGED → VALIDATED → ANALYSIS_READY → CARTOGRAPHY_READY` state machine
  (`agent/dataset_status.py`) that layers/tools now advance through, with automated checks
  wired into the gate rather than left as documentation — geometry QA (duplicate/overlapping
  features, small-polygon threshold), P-code uniqueness/hierarchy validation
  (`agent/pcode_validation.py`, alias-list field matching for real COD-AB naming variance),
  and opt-in schema contracts (`agent/schema_contracts.py` + `agent/contracts/*.json` for
  health facilities and admin2 boundaries) that check field presence, type, and controlled
  vocabularies. A machine-readable provenance sidecar (`agent/provenance.py`,
  `write_provenance_sidecar`) assembles QGIS version, tool-lineage, and QA-gate history into
  a `.provenance.json` written beside the layer's own source file.
- **GDPR compliance remediation.** Closed finding F1 (global memory had no bulk erasure
  path) with `MemoryManager.clear_global_notes()` plus a confirm-gated "Clear Global Memory"
  UI control, and remediated four further HIGH findings (F2–F5) from the same review. The F1
  fix had been made independently on both diverged repo lines; the reconciliation above
  de-duplicated it rather than shipping two competing implementations.
- **Task register wired end to end.** The 791-task/35-section Humanitarian Mapping Task
  Register now drives the chat send path (matching, prompt enrichment, output-contract
  routing) instead of sitting beside it as reference data — see the `[1.4.4]` entry below for
  the register itself; this release is where dispatch actually runs through it.
- **QGIS 4.x/Qt6 enum-compatibility, generalized.** Replaced the ~15 site-by-site hand-rolled
  fixes with a shared runtime resolver (`agent/tools/_qgis_enum_compat.py`'s
  `resolve_qgis_enum`) that tries the QGIS 4.x scoped form first and falls back to the QGIS
  3.x flat form — applied across `styling_tools.py`, `raster_tools.py`, `task_runner.py`,
  `layout_tools.py`, `export_tools.py`, and `humanitarian_tools.py`. A live QGIS 4.2.2 smoke
  test (below) caught one class this pattern hadn't yet reached.
- **Live-verified critical fix: `QgsColorRampShaderItem` import crash.** Found by running a
  real headless PyQGIS session (QGIS 4.2.2's own Python, not the sandboxed no-QGIS suite,
  after the plugin's GUI proved undriveable in this deployment environment) against a
  purpose-built test dataset: `agent/tools/raster_tools.py`'s top-level import of
  `QgsColorRampShaderItem` raises `ImportError` on real QGIS 4.2.2 — the class moved to
  `QgsColorRampShader.ColorRampItem` — silently setting `QGIS_AVAILABLE = False` for the
  whole file and degrading all 11 raster tools (hillshade, slope, aspect, zonal statistics,
  clip, both classification tools, histogram equalization, mosaic, band composite,
  pan-sharpening) in any real live session. Invisible to the sandboxed suite by construction.
  Fixed with the same dual-form resolution pattern; re-verified live afterward, 14/14 smoke
  test categories passing including two real network calls. See `docs/BUG_TRACKER.md`
  BUG-2026-09-05-1.
- **Live-verified GUI: the print-layout disclaimer footer.** `[1.5.0]`'s dark-theme fix and
  BUG-2026-09-02-6's fabrication-safety footer had both shipped `fixed-unverified-pending-
  live-session`. Directly confirmed this cycle via a real chat-driven `create_print_layout`
  call in a live QGIS 4.2.2 session (Google Gemini (Hosted) provider): the standing
  disclaimer footer renders correctly and legibly in landscape orientation, alongside a real
  graduated-severity legend, scale bar, and north arrow. Portrait orientation's tighter fit
  remains unconfirmed.
- **Auth-system diagnostic.** From a live bug report (`authManager().isDisabled()` on a real
  QGIS 4.2 session): `CredentialManager.auth_system_status()`/
  `get_auth_system_diagnostic_message()` now surface the two real, documented root causes (a
  QGIS 3.40.4+ proxy-authcfg regression, or a missing QCA-OpenSSL backend) and their fixes
  directly in the existing plaintext-fallback warning, instead of an unexplained generic
  message.
- **Humanitarian incident coding.** `add_incident_point`/`add_point_layer` gained optional
  ACLED-style (`event_type`/`sub_event_type`) and IMSMA/IMAS-style (`hazard_type`/
  `contamination_status`) controlled-vocabulary fields alongside the existing freeform
  `severity`/`category` — advisory validation only, an unrecognized value returns a warning
  rather than rejecting the point.
- **Road-snapped delivery routes.** `optimize_delivery_route` accepts an optional
  `road_network_layer`; when given, it chains `native:shortestpathpointtopoint` across the
  computed stop order into a real road-snapped route line instead of leaving callers to draw
  a straight line through stops and present it as a route.
- **Sandbox hardening.** Closed 4 live bypasses of the `execute_pyqgis_script` safety sandbox
  found on re-review.
- **Release packaging.** `.bak`/`.orig`/`.rej` backup files no longer ship in the release ZIP;
  the ZIP's top-level folder name is now pinned rather than derived from the build directory
  (a prior build had shipped under a scratch-directory name, causing QGIS to install it
  alongside the real plugin instead of replacing it — see `docs/BUG_TRACKER.md`
  BUG-2026-08-21-6 lineage).

## [1.5.0] — adaptive self-learning + confirmed QGIS 4.2/Qt6 fixes

- **Adaptive self-learning system.** New `agent/learning.py` layers four
  mechanisms on top of the existing `SpatialMemoryManager` global-note store
  (no new storage plumbing): passive preference detection (scoped to
  connection-provider choice for this first pass, requiring 5+ samples and a
  70%+ dominant share before acting), correction learning (a text heuristic
  over the message right after a tool call — "that's wrong", "undo that",
  etc. — stored as a standing rule), usage-pattern counters (tool/provider
  frequency, surfaced to the model as context, never silently changing a UI
  default), and a new **🎓 Learned Preferences & Rules** row in the Tasks &
  Memory tab (dropdown + **🗑 Forget Selected**) so anything inferred is
  visible and removable. `get_formatted_memory_context()` now buckets global
  notes under labeled headings (Learned Preferences / Correction Rules /
  Usage Patterns / User Global Preferences) instead of one flat list. 17 new
  tests in `tests/test_learning.py`; the `agent.py` wiring and UI addition
  are unverified in a live QGIS session (same structural limitation as every
  other UI/agent-lifecycle change — see `docs/BUG_TRACKER.md` BUG-2026-09-02-5).
- **QGIS 4.2/Qt6 enum-scoping fixes**, discovered via three rounds of live
  crash reports during real QGIS 4.2 testing and shipped under the unchanged
  `1.4.4` version number without a release cut — recorded here retroactively.
  Fixed flat-vs-scoped enum access across `Qt`, `QScrollArea`,
  `QDialogButtonBox`, `QLineEdit`, and `QPalette` (dock panel open,
  scroll-area frames, dialog buttons, password fields, live theme palette
  extraction) — see `docs/BUG_TRACKER.md` BUG-2026-09-02-1 through -3 for the
  full per-symbol breakdown and verification status.
- **Dark-theme chat rendering fix.** `chat_formatting.py`'s `render_markdown()`
  was hardcoded to fixed light-theme colors for code blocks, inline code,
  tables, blockquotes, and `<hr>`, disconnected from the already
  theme-aware bubble colors — confirmed via a live screenshot showing
  near-invisible white-on-white table text in QGIS dark theme. Colors now
  thread through from the same theme-derived dict the chat bubbles already
  use. Two new system-prompt rules (40, 41) address related live feedback:
  default to creating a real map layer for mappable results instead of only
  describing them in chat, and never silently guess a year/date a tool
  parameter left unspecified. See BUG-2026-09-02-4.

## [1.4.4] — sector-guided mapping experience

### Humanitarian Mapping Task Register, wired end to end

The register (791 tasks across 35 sections) now drives the chat send path
instead of sitting beside it.

- **Every task declares what it takes in and what it puts out.** New
  `agent/file_io.py` models the media kinds the plugin can actually ingest --
  picture, PDF, TXT, Word, spreadsheet, vector, raster, QGIS project -- each
  with a real registered tool behind it, and the artifact each output contract
  leaves on disk (`.pdf`/`.png` for a layout, `.html` for a dashboard, `.csv`
  for an analysis, `.gpkg` for an export). Both fields are derived for all 791
  tasks by `tools/derive_task_io.py`; `tests/test_file_io.py` re-runs the
  derivation and fails if the committed register has drifted from it.
- **Attachments join the task.** A file attached in chat is classified, routed
  to the tool that can read it (a 3W spreadsheet to `load_3w_data`, a damage
  photo to `extract_features_from_imagery`, a sitrep to `extract_pdf_tables`),
  and carried into the next message rather than analysed as a side errand.
- **The prompt is shown before it is sent.** A new preview panel (on by
  default, Settings ▸ *Show the prompt and reasoning before sending*) displays
  the literal text that will be sent -- the user turn, plus the addendum added
  to the system prompt -- together with the reasoning: which task matched and
  how confidently, what will be delivered, which values were assumed, and what
  each attached file will be read as. No extra API call; it renders text that
  has already been composed locally.
- **Only genuinely unanswerable gaps interrupt.** Slots QGIS can answer (area
  of interest, from the open project) are answered; slots with a safe default
  are filled and stated in the preview; only hazard type, facility type and
  sector -- where a guess produces confidently wrong humanitarian output --
  stop and ask. That is ~10% of tasks rather than ~89%.
- **The answer is checked against the contract.** New `agent/output_router.py`
  compares the tools that actually ran against what the task promised. A
  dashboard task that ended in prose gets exactly one follow-up turn naming
  the missing renderer; the reason is written into the chat, and if it is still
  not produced the chat says so rather than describing an artifact that does
  not exist.
- Fixed five tasks that asked "which facility or service type?" about a
  statistical distribution (*Map population distribution*, *Map age and sex
  distribution*, and three others) because `distribution` also names a
  distribution point. Real distribution-point tasks keep the slot.
- **The click-through itself is now verified, not just the logic behind it.**
  New `tests/test_chat_widget_live.py` boots a real `QgsApplication`, builds
  the real dock and chat widgets, and drives them with `QTest.mouseClick` on
  the actual buttons -- the requirement panel, the prompt preview, and the
  output-contract follow-up, previously proven correct only at the level of
  pure-logic unit tests and static source inspection. It caught a real bug
  doing it: `_dispatch_message` had a stale `analysis is None` fallback that
  silently re-applied the register's enrichment -- and its output contract --
  after clicking "Send my wording only", the escape hatch for when the
  matched task is simply wrong. Fixed; the button now dispatches the user's
  own wording with no contract attached, as intended.

- Added sector-aware prompt guidance for humanitarian aid, engineering, urban planning, logistics, agriculture, environment, public health, disaster risk, utilities, transport, public safety, research, real estate, and defense/intelligence profiles.
- Priority rollout documented: humanitarian aid, engineering, urban planning, then logistics.
- Verified against the Community and private prompt-refiner suites.


## [1.4.3] — UI terminology and navigation polish

- Standardized the main tabs as **Chat**, **Tasks & Notes**, and **Help & Guide** in both plugin editions.
- Normalized commercial provider labels to Hosted/Local terminology.
- Clarified Settings connection naming and project-notes labels.
- Automated UI regression suites remain green: 691 private tests and 620 Community tests.


All notable changes to Cartogen AI are documented here, newest first. Format
loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

> **Repo note:** this file's history up through v1.3.0 was carried over verbatim
> from the old `qgis_ai_assistant` repo as part of a from-scratch copy/restructure
> into this new `cartogen-ai` repo — it is **not** a git history migration. Full
> commit history back to v0.2.0 remains available in the old repo
> (`C:\qgis_ai_assistant`) if ever needed.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-08-22

- **`ui/dock_widget.py` class split**, per `docs/DOCK_WIDGET_SPLIT_PLAN_2026-08-21.md`. The
  1,355-line `CartogenAiDockWidget` is now the outer dock (signals, header, tab wiring) with
  the Chat, Tasks & Memory, and Help tabs each extracted into their own `QWidget` class
  (`ChatTabWidget`, `TasksTabWidget`, `HelpTabWidget`), plus two small shared-code extractions
  (`dock_constants.py`, `theme.py`) needed to avoid a circular import. Code moved verbatim —
  no logic changes. Verified by constructing the dock offscreen against a real QGIS Python
  environment (`python-qgis-ltr.bat`, `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`): all modules import
  cleanly, all 3 tabs are present, and every cross-tab signal connection fires correctly.
  **Not yet verified in a real interactive QGIS session** — run
  `docs/RELEASE_SMOKE_TEST.md` before relying on this in production.
- **Cartogen Cloud Connect Gateway wired in as a selectable provider** (not yet functional —
  no gateway is deployed anywhere). `CartogenClient` is now exported from `agent/providers`,
  registered in `agent.py`'s provider selection, and added to `ui/settings_dialog.py`'s
  provider dropdown (deliberately placed last, not default, until a real gateway exists).
  `providers/cartogen.py` gained a `list_models()` function for the Settings dialog's model
  picker. See `docs/PRO_TIER_BUILD_PLAN_2026-08-21.md` for what's still needed (gateway
  deployment, billing lifecycle, key-retrieval auth) before this tier has real value.
- **Fixed:** `tests/test_export_tools.py`'s `TestGenerateHtmlDashboardConnectivityNote` now
  skips when `folium` is absent instead of failing, matching every other optional-dependency
  guard in the suite.
- Added placeholder `README.md`s to the empty `cartogen-ai-pro/`/`cartogen-ai-enterprise/`
  sibling directories so they no longer read as "the private repo exists."

## [1.4.1] — 2026-08-21

Follow-up fixes after the `[1.4.0]` consolidation, from direct feedback that two problems slipped
through:

- **Living docs still named/linked like leftovers.** `QGIS_AI_Agent_Feature_List.md` and
  `QGIS_AI_Agent_PRD.md` renamed to `CARTOGEN_AI_FEATURE_LIST.md`/`CARTOGEN_AI_PRD.md` and fully
  rebranded. Unlike `CHANGELOG.md`'s past entries, these are living reference docs, not
  historical logs — renaming/translating them isn't a rewrite-history concern.
- **44 broken links.** Every `file:///c:/qgis_ai_assistant/...` absolute link (hardcoded to the
  old machine's path) converted to a relative link.
- Updated every live reference to the renamed files: `agent/scheduler.py`,
  `agent/tools/monitoring_tools.py`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `plugin_upload.py`'s
  `EXCLUDE_FILES`, `docs/PRODUCT_TIERS.md`, `docs/HUMANITARIAN_GIS_FEATURE_REVIEW.md`,
  `docs/SAM_IMAGERY_EXTRACTION_SPEC.md`.
- Left the genuinely dated/historical docs untouched (this file's own past entries,
  `docs/STATUS_REVIEW_2026-08-20.md`, `docs/SECURITY_AND_COMPETITIVE_REVIEW_2026-08.md`) — they
  describe real past states, not leftover branding, per this project's frozen-doc convention.

**Added [docs/OPEN_CORE_REPO_STRATEGY.md](docs/OPEN_CORE_REPO_STRATEGY.md):** this repo stays the
single public Community codebase. Professional and Enterprise are decided (not yet built) to live
in a separate private repo that one-way-syncs from this one via GitHub Actions, distributed from
the project website with license-key gating. This resolves the licensing tension
`docs/TIER_RESTRUCTURE_PROPOSAL_2026-08-20.md` flagged but didn't settle — Community stays
genuinely GPL v2/open in this repo; only the unbuilt Pro/Enterprise-only code would be
proprietary, in the other repo. Added `.github/workflows/sync-to-private.yml` as an inactive
scaffold (needs a real target repo before it can run).

## [1.4.0] — 2026-08-21

**Consolidated the dual-tree architecture into this single repo.** Previously,
`C:\qgis_ai_assistant` maintained two parallel plugin trees — a root source tree
(`CartogenAiCore`/`cartogen_ai_core`, renamed in `[1.3.0]` below) and a separately
distributed `Cartogen AI/cartogen_ai/` copy (`CartogenAi`/`cartogen_ai`) kept in
sync by `build_cartogen_ai.py`, so two QGIS plugin listings could exist side by
side. This repo (`C:\cartogen-ai`) is the single, consolidated result of copying
the root tree over and dropping the now-unnecessary `_core` suffix.

- Renamed: `CartogenAiCore` → `CartogenAi`, `cartogen_ai_core` → `cartogen_ai`,
  `CartogenAiCoreDockWidget`/`CartogenAiCoreSettingsDialog` → `CartogenAiDockWidget`/
  `CartogenAiSettingsDialog`, `cartogen_ai_core.py` → `cartogen_ai.py`
- **Another breaking change**, same caveat as `[1.3.0]`: the QSettings key prefix
  moved again, `cartogen_ai_core/...` → `cartogen_ai/...`
- `build_cartogen_ai.py` retired — no second tree left to sync into
- `plugin_upload.py` simplified for single-tree packaging (`PLUGIN_NAME = "cartogen_ai"`)
- Added Claude Code / GitHub scaffolding: `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/workflows/tests.yml`,
  issue templates, PR template
- The 3 planned editions (Community/Pro/Enterprise — see
  [docs/PRODUCT_TIERS.md](docs/PRODUCT_TIERS.md)) are reflected in documentation
  only; nothing in this codebase is tier-gated yet, per the project's existing
  honest-status convention (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- `service/data/pgdata/` (a live Postgres data directory that had been committed
  to git in the old repo) was **not** carried over — it's runtime state, not
  source, and shouldn't have been tracked in the first place
- 691 tests, same known baseline, verified in this new tree post-copy

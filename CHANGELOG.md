# Changelog

**[1.3.0] and earlier moved to `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`** in the 2026-08-31 documentation pass -- this file had grown to 2,146 lines covering every version since `[0.1.2]`, most of it from the very early, rapid `[1.2.x]` patch cycle. The split point is `[1.4.0]`, this project's own documented milestone (the dual-tree-to-single-tree consolidation --
see the `[1.4.0]` entry below and `CONTRIBUTING.md`). Entries were relocated verbatim, not rewritten, per this project's convention that past changelog entries are a historical record (`CONTRIBUTING.md` §2) -- only the file they live in changed.


## [1.4.4] — sector-guided mapping experience

### Humanitarian Mapping Task Register, wired end to end

The register (791 tasks across 35 sections) now drives the chat send path
instead of sitting beside it.

- **Every task declares what it takes in and what it puts out.** New
  `agent/file_io.py` models the media kinds the plugin can actually ingest --
  picture, PDF, TXT, Word, spreadsheet, vector, raster, QGIS project -- each
  with a real registered tool behind it, and the artifact each output contract
  leaves on disk (`.pdf`/`.png` for a layout, `.html` for a dashboard, `.csv`
  for an analysis, `.gpkg` for an export). Both fields are derived for all 791
  tasks by `tools/derive_task_io.py`; `tests/test_file_io.py` re-runs the
  derivation and fails if the committed register has drifted from it.
- **Attachments join the task.** A file attached in chat is classified, routed
  to the tool that can read it (a 3W spreadsheet to `load_3w_data`, a damage
  photo to `extract_features_from_imagery`, a sitrep to `extract_pdf_tables`),
  and carried into the next message rather than analysed as a side errand.
- **The prompt is shown before it is sent.** A new preview panel (on by
  default, Settings ▸ *Show the prompt and reasoning before sending*) displays
  the literal text that will be sent -- the user turn, plus the addendum added
  to the system prompt -- together with the reasoning: which task matched and
  how confidently, what will be delivered, which values were assumed, and what
  each attached file will be read as. No extra API call; it renders text that
  has already been composed locally.
- **Only genuinely unanswerable gaps interrupt.** Slots QGIS can answer (area
  of interest, from the open project) are answered; slots with a safe default
  are filled and stated in the preview; only hazard type, facility type and
  sector -- where a guess produces confidently wrong humanitarian output --
  stop and ask. That is ~10% of tasks rather than ~89%.
- **The answer is checked against the contract.** New `agent/output_router.py`
  compares the tools that actually ran against what the task promised. A
  dashboard task that ended in prose gets exactly one follow-up turn naming
  the missing renderer; the reason is written into the chat, and if it is still
  not produced the chat says so rather than describing an artifact that does
  not exist.
- Fixed five tasks that asked "which facility or service type?" about a
  statistical distribution (*Map population distribution*, *Map age and sex
  distribution*, and three others) because `distribution` also names a
  distribution point. Real distribution-point tasks keep the slot.
- **The click-through itself is now verified, not just the logic behind it.**
  New `tests/test_chat_widget_live.py` boots a real `QgsApplication`, builds
  the real dock and chat widgets, and drives them with `QTest.mouseClick` on
  the actual buttons -- the requirement panel, the prompt preview, and the
  output-contract follow-up, previously proven correct only at the level of
  pure-logic unit tests and static source inspection. It caught a real bug
  doing it: `_dispatch_message` had a stale `analysis is None` fallback that
  silently re-applied the register's enrichment -- and its output contract --
  after clicking "Send my wording only", the escape hatch for when the
  matched task is simply wrong. Fixed; the button now dispatches the user's
  own wording with no contract attached, as intended.

- Added sector-aware prompt guidance for humanitarian aid, engineering, urban planning, logistics, agriculture, environment, public health, disaster risk, utilities, transport, public safety, research, real estate, and defense/intelligence profiles.
- Priority rollout documented: humanitarian aid, engineering, urban planning, then logistics.
- Verified against the Community and private prompt-refiner suites.


## [1.4.3] — UI terminology and navigation polish

- Standardized the main tabs as **Chat**, **Tasks & Notes**, and **Help & Guide** in both plugin editions.
- Normalized commercial provider labels to Hosted/Local terminology.
- Clarified Settings connection naming and project-notes labels.
- Automated UI regression suites remain green: 691 private tests and 620 Community tests.


All notable changes to Cartogen AI are documented here, newest first. Format
loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

> **Repo note:** this file's history up through v1.3.0 was carried over verbatim
> from the old `qgis_ai_assistant` repo as part of a from-scratch copy/restructure
> into this new `cartogen-ai` repo — it is **not** a git history migration. Full
> commit history back to v0.2.0 remains available in the old repo
> (`C:\qgis_ai_assistant`) if ever needed.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-08-22

- **`ui/dock_widget.py` class split**, per `docs/DOCK_WIDGET_SPLIT_PLAN_2026-08-21.md`. The
  1,355-line `CartogenAiDockWidget` is now the outer dock (signals, header, tab wiring) with
  the Chat, Tasks & Memory, and Help tabs each extracted into their own `QWidget` class
  (`ChatTabWidget`, `TasksTabWidget`, `HelpTabWidget`), plus two small shared-code extractions
  (`dock_constants.py`, `theme.py`) needed to avoid a circular import. Code moved verbatim —
  no logic changes. Verified by constructing the dock offscreen against a real QGIS Python
  environment (`python-qgis-ltr.bat`, `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`): all modules import
  cleanly, all 3 tabs are present, and every cross-tab signal connection fires correctly.
  **Not yet verified in a real interactive QGIS session** — run
  `docs/RELEASE_SMOKE_TEST.md` before relying on this in production.
- **Cartogen Cloud Connect Gateway wired in as a selectable provider** (not yet functional —
  no gateway is deployed anywhere). `CartogenClient` is now exported from `agent/providers`,
  registered in `agent.py`'s provider selection, and added to `ui/settings_dialog.py`'s
  provider dropdown (deliberately placed last, not default, until a real gateway exists).
  `providers/cartogen.py` gained a `list_models()` function for the Settings dialog's model
  picker. See `docs/PRO_TIER_BUILD_PLAN_2026-08-21.md` for what's still needed (gateway
  deployment, billing lifecycle, key-retrieval auth) before this tier has real value.
- **Fixed:** `tests/test_export_tools.py`'s `TestGenerateHtmlDashboardConnectivityNote` now
  skips when `folium` is absent instead of failing, matching every other optional-dependency
  guard in the suite.
- Added placeholder `README.md`s to the empty `cartogen-ai-pro/`/`cartogen-ai-enterprise/`
  sibling directories so they no longer read as "the private repo exists."

## [1.4.1] — 2026-08-21

Follow-up fixes after the `[1.4.0]` consolidation, from direct feedback that two problems slipped
through:

- **Living docs still named/linked like leftovers.** `QGIS_AI_Agent_Feature_List.md` and
  `QGIS_AI_Agent_PRD.md` renamed to `CARTOGEN_AI_FEATURE_LIST.md`/`CARTOGEN_AI_PRD.md` and fully
  rebranded. Unlike `CHANGELOG.md`'s past entries, these are living reference docs, not
  historical logs — renaming/translating them isn't a rewrite-history concern.
- **44 broken links.** Every `file:///c:/qgis_ai_assistant/...` absolute link (hardcoded to the
  old machine's path) converted to a relative link.
- Updated every live reference to the renamed files: `agent/scheduler.py`,
  `agent/tools/monitoring_tools.py`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `plugin_upload.py`'s
  `EXCLUDE_FILES`, `docs/PRODUCT_TIERS.md`, `docs/HUMANITARIAN_GIS_FEATURE_REVIEW.md`,
  `docs/SAM_IMAGERY_EXTRACTION_SPEC.md`.
- Left the genuinely dated/historical docs untouched (this file's own past entries,
  `docs/STATUS_REVIEW_2026-08-20.md`, `docs/SECURITY_AND_COMPETITIVE_REVIEW_2026-08.md`) — they
  describe real past states, not leftover branding, per this project's frozen-doc convention.

**Added [docs/OPEN_CORE_REPO_STRATEGY.md](docs/OPEN_CORE_REPO_STRATEGY.md):** this repo stays the
single public Community codebase. Professional and Enterprise are decided (not yet built) to live
in a separate private repo that one-way-syncs from this one via GitHub Actions, distributed from
the project website with license-key gating. This resolves the licensing tension
`docs/TIER_RESTRUCTURE_PROPOSAL_2026-08-20.md` flagged but didn't settle — Community stays
genuinely GPL v2/open in this repo; only the unbuilt Pro/Enterprise-only code would be
proprietary, in the other repo. Added `.github/workflows/sync-to-private.yml` as an inactive
scaffold (needs a real target repo before it can run).

## [1.4.0] — 2026-08-21

**Consolidated the dual-tree architecture into this single repo.** Previously,
`C:\qgis_ai_assistant` maintained two parallel plugin trees — a root source tree
(`CartogenAiCore`/`cartogen_ai_core`, renamed in `[1.3.0]` below) and a separately
distributed `Cartogen AI/cartogen_ai/` copy (`CartogenAi`/`cartogen_ai`) kept in
sync by `build_cartogen_ai.py`, so two QGIS plugin listings could exist side by
side. This repo (`C:\cartogen-ai`) is the single, consolidated result of copying
the root tree over and dropping the now-unnecessary `_core` suffix.

- Renamed: `CartogenAiCore` → `CartogenAi`, `cartogen_ai_core` → `cartogen_ai`,
  `CartogenAiCoreDockWidget`/`CartogenAiCoreSettingsDialog` → `CartogenAiDockWidget`/
  `CartogenAiSettingsDialog`, `cartogen_ai_core.py` → `cartogen_ai.py`
- **Another breaking change**, same caveat as `[1.3.0]`: the QSettings key prefix
  moved again, `cartogen_ai_core/...` → `cartogen_ai/...`
- `build_cartogen_ai.py` retired — no second tree left to sync into
- `plugin_upload.py` simplified for single-tree packaging (`PLUGIN_NAME = "cartogen_ai"`)
- Added Claude Code / GitHub scaffolding: `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/workflows/tests.yml`,
  issue templates, PR template
- The 3 planned editions (Community/Pro/Enterprise — see
  [docs/PRODUCT_TIERS.md](docs/PRODUCT_TIERS.md)) are reflected in documentation
  only; nothing in this codebase is tier-gated yet, per the project's existing
  honest-status convention (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- `service/data/pgdata/` (a live Postgres data directory that had been committed
  to git in the old repo) was **not** carried over — it's runtime state, not
  source, and shouldn't have been tracked in the first place
- 691 tests, same known baseline, verified in this new tree post-copy
